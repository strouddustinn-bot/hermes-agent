/**
 * The workflows you have, and which one is open.
 *
 * A canvas holds one scenario, so everything else — the switcher, the empty
 * state, the agent's idea of "the workflow" — needs somewhere the set of them
 * lives. That's here, and it's deliberately small: a list of scenarios by id,
 * a pointer at one of them, and the four things you can do to the list.
 *
 * `Scenario` is the stored shape rather than React Flow's nodes and edges,
 * because it's the schema `graph.ts`, `graph-tools.ts` and the agent already
 * agree on, and it round-trips losslessly through `toScenario`/`fromScenario`
 * — card positions included. Persistence is the plugin's own namespaced
 * storage: no backend, and nothing of this leaves the machine.
