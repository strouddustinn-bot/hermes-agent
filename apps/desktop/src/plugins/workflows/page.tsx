           That matters because the handles sit at 50% and the cards in a rank
           are centre-aligned: growing downward walked every handle down with
           the card, so the whole graph's wiring sagged and re-settled each time

           transform on the card: origin feeds `positionAbsolute`, so bounds,
           fitView, hit-testing and edge geometry all agree. A CSS transform
